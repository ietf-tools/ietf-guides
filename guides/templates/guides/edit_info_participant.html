  <h2>Enter Your IETF Participation Information</h2>

  <p>The IETF Guides program does its best to match IETF newcomers with a Guide that shares common interests and spoken languages.  Note, though, it is not always possible to perform perfect matches, but all of our experienced Guides will still be able to introduce you to the processes and culture of the IETF as a whole.  Please fill out the following form to help us match you up with the best possible Guide.</p>

  <h3>Information storage policy</h3>

  <p>See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/privacy-statement/">Statement concerning personal data</a>, particularly for its statement on consent.</p>
  <p>The information stored in the Guides system is cleared between every IETF.  You will need to reapply for each IETF if you wish to have a guide assigned for your second or third IETF.</p>
