Dear {{match.participant.given_name}} and {{match.guide.given_name}},

Welcome to the guides programme! In this programme we aim to
facilitate knowledge transfer between experienced IETF-ers and new
participants in the community. The IETF is not your typical
organization so some help along the way might help you make your
landing a bit smoother, so you will stay with us longer!

It is my pleasure to introduce you to each
other. {{match.guide.given_name}} has kindly offered to be
{{match.participant.given_name}}'s guide for the upcoming IETF
meeting. {{match.participant.given_name}} has expressed a specific
interest in:

  Topics: {{ match.participant.topics }}

  Areas: {{ match.participant.areas.all|join:", " }}

  Groups: {{ match.participant.groups }}

The IETF guides program aims to have three parts: 

0. Introduction conversations before the meeting
1. (virtual) face to face meeting at the beginning of the meeting
2. (virtual) check-in during the week.

It would be great if you could meet early in the week and discuss
questions, interests, and 'how-to-get-things-done' in the IETF,
and perhaps have a follow-up during the week to check-in whether
there are any questions.  Hopefully you'll both have the chance
to attend the welcome reception on Sunday at 17:00.

You both have the responsibility to make meetings between you happen,
but it would be great if the guide would take the lead in setting up
the first meeting.  We suggest the following potential mechanisms for
meeting up virtually:

1. ietf.gather.town -- the IETF virtual "hallway" meeting spot
   (look for the link in the IETF quick-connections agenda slot)
2. E-Mail of course!
3. Jabber -- the IETF standardized chat protocol
4. Slack -- ietf.slack.org
5. A conferencing system of your choosing (google meet, zoom, etc)
6. Even the good old fashioned telephone

As an IETF participant it would help if you follow your interests
within the IETF: Ask the guide what you think you need to make the
meeting a success. The guide is there to help you, but the guide
likely also knows many things that "you don't know you need to know"!

Good topics of conversation include the IETF toolchain, the meeting
agenda, the IETF app, how to use jabber rooms, the IETF document
datatracker (where all Internet Drafts, Working Group and Research
Group agenda's and RFCs can be found), and more! Much of this info can
also be found in the Tao of the IETF at https://ietf.org/tao .
Additionally, we have prepared the following list of conversation
topics that past participants have found useful to discuss:
https://www.isi.edu/~hardaker/ietf/topics.html

Specific questions about your favorite topics of interest are wise to
discuss such as: relevant working groups or research groups, relevant
authors, working group chairs and area directors.  You might want to
discuss trending issues in the upcoming meetings (also check the ISOC
"rough guides" in the IETF journal).

Note that some guides have graciously agreed to help more than one
newcomer to the IETF.  Your assigned guide may request to schedule
meetings with multiple newcomers in order to accommodate their time
schedule.

Please let us if there is any way in which we can support your
interactions.  Please mail any questions you have to
mentoring-coordinators@ietf.org.

Cheers,
Wes Hardaker, Barbara Stark and Paul Wouters
IETF Guides Program Leads
